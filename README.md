Building a basic recipe website
<<<<<<< HEAD
Hello Odin
=======

Apply concepts learned from HTML basics to create a recipes Website. The goal will be to include a main index page that will have links to other webpages. This project will be revisited and later include concepts of CSS to style of the webpage. Create links, add images, use tags, anchors, use git and push commits over to Github.
